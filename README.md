PROM dumps from Mycron cards
===========================

We currently have PROM dumps from three different card types: 

- DIM-1001 CPU card using the Intel 8080 processor. It looks like these should be
  correct and functional, but we have not examined them in any detail.
- DIM-1002 Communication Processor. These have not been examined. 
- DIM-1003 CPU card using the Z-80 processor. Most of the work has
  been focused around this card.
