These are PROM dumps from two Intel 8080-based DIM-1001 CPU cards. 

The serial numbers are the ones printed on the cards. 

Each chip is a 256-byte PROM chip, so 8 chips are necessary to
implement a 2KiB PROM.

The two dumps are identical apart from a single byte in chip 0:
- SN3191 reports as MYCROP 3.1
- SN3256 reports as MYCROP 3.2

Since there is only a single digit difference, it's likely that the
PROM dumps have not suffered from bit rot.
